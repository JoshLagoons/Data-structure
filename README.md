# Data-structure
The array is being a data structure that stored the fixed numbers of elements being the same data type while the map uses a higher order function that gives the function to each element of a list. The stack is a collection that stores elements in LIFO style. The Queue uses a FIFO style of collection of storing the elements

The difference of the array and map is that a map class is to be more efficient on than making an array class from how a map provides a counting arrangement that stores big data into it while an array class you need to manually add how much you want it to store whether on the amount you want to provide. 
The difference of the stack and the queue is that they use different terminology on what they opaerate, stack uses a push on placing the element in the order but takes it away with a pop and puts it on the top when pushing it and using a Last in first out(LIFO). However, the queue uses the method of when ordering you insert the elements by enqueuing and taking them out by dequeue and uses the First in first out (FIFO).
